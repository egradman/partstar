PartStar 
-----------

An open-source robot kit for sorting hardware and other small parts.

As an inventor with a small workshop, I often find myself with large bins of
unsorted hardware: screws, bolts, nuts, resistors, etc.

I aim to use an off-the-shelf webcam and some simple robotics to create a
small-part hardware sorting machine. Users of this device can toss unsorted
hardware into the hopper, and expect the robot to sort the hardware on
user-specified criteria (a user-supplied computer will perform the
computer-vision tasks and control the robot firmware.)

Furthermore, it should be easy to train the device on new parts.
Characteristics of new parts are shared through a public hosted database, so
that the robot's ability to distinguish among commonly presented parts improves
over time.

The name is a play on "CoinStar," which performs the same function for coins. I
don't know if that's "confusingly similar" enough to want to change the name.
Your input is welcome!
